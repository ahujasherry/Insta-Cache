Designed and implemented a custom in-memory database inspired by Redis, coupled with a user-friendly web interface using React to manage cached data efficiently. Key features included:
Custom In-Memory Database: Developed a high-performance, key-value store that supports caching of frequently accessed data, achieving a 90% cache hit rate and reducing database load by 30% through effective caching strategies.
Dynamic UI for Cache Management: Built a responsive web interface enabling users to easily add, retrieve, and delete cache items, improving user experience and operational efficiency.
Real-Time Performance Metrics: Implemented a dashboard displaying cache performance metrics, allowing users to monitor usage statistics and optimize caching strategies.
